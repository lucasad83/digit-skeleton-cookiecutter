User Guide
==========

This is the user guide
for the `DIGIT Skeleton Cookiecutter`_,
a Python template based on the `Hypermodern Python`_ article series.

If you're in a hurry, check out the :doc:`quickstart guide <quickstart>`
and the :ref:`tutorials <Tutorials>`.


Introduction
~~~~~~~~~~~~

About this project
------------------

The |DSC| is a general-purpose template for Python libraries and applications,
released under the `MIT license`_
and hosted on `GitHub <DIGIT Skeleton Cookiecutter_>`__.

The main objective of this project template is to
enable current best practices
through modern Python tooling.
Our goals are to:

- focus on simplicity and minimalism,
- promote code quality through automation, and
- provide reliable and repeatable processes,

all the way from local testing to publishing releases.

Projects are created from the template using Cookiecutter_,
a project scaffolding tool built on top of the Jinja_ template engine.

The project template is centered around the following tools:

- Poetry_ for packaging and dependency management
- Nox_ for automation of checks and other development tasks

.. _Installation:

Installation
~~~~~~~~~~~~

System requirements
-------------------

You need a recent Windows, Linux, Unix, or Mac system with git_ installed.

.. note::

   When working with this template on Windows,
   configure your text editor or IDE
   to use only `UNIX-style line endings`__ (line feeds).

   __ https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newline

   The project template contains a `.gitattributes`_ file
   which enables end-of-line normalization for your entire working tree.
   Additionally, the Prettier_ code formatter converts line endings to line feeds.
   Windows-style line endings (``CRLF``) should therefore never make it into your Git repository.

   .. _.gitattributes: https://git-scm.com/book/en/Customizing-Git-Git-Attributes

   Nonetheless, configuring your editor for line feeds is recommended
   to avoid complaints from the pre-commit_ hook for Prettier.


Getting Python (Windows)
------------------------

If you're on Windows,
download the recommended installer for the latest stable release of Python
from the official `Python website`__.
Before clicking **Install now**,
enable the option to add Python to your ``PATH`` environment variable.

Verify your installation by checking the output of the following commands in a new terminal window::

   python -VV
   py -VV

Both of these commands should display the latest Python version, 3.10.

For local testing with multiple Python versions,
repeat these steps for the latest bugfix releases of Python 3.7+,
with the following changes:

- Do *not* enable the option to add Python to the ``PATH`` environment variable.
- ``py -VV`` and ``python -VV`` should still display the version of the latest stable release.
- ``py -X.Y -VV`` (e.g. ``py -3.7 -VV``) should display the exact version you just installed.

Note that binary installers are not provided for security releases.

__ https://www.python.org/


Getting Python (Mac, Linux, Unix)
---------------------------------

If you're on a Mac, Linux, or Unix system,
use pyenv_ for installing and managing Python versions.
Please refer to the documentation of this project
for detailed installation and usage instructions.
(The following instructions assume that
your system already has bash_ and curl_ installed.)

Install pyenv_ like this:

.. code:: console

   $ curl https://pyenv.run | bash

Add the following lines to your ``~/.bashrc``:

.. code:: sh

   export PATH="$HOME/.pyenv/bin:$PATH"
   eval "$(pyenv init -)"
   eval "$(pyenv virtualenv-init -)"

Install the Python build dependencies for your platform,
using one of the commands listed in the
`official instructions`__.

__ https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv/wiki/Common-build-problems

Install the latest point release of every supported Python version.
This project template supports Python 3.7, 3.8, 3.9, and 3.10.

.. code:: console

   $ pyenv install 3.7.12
   $ pyenv install 3.8.12
   $ pyenv install 3.9.10
   $ pyenv install 3.10.2

After creating your project (see :ref:`below <Creating a project>`),
you can make these Python versions accessible in the project directory,
using the following command:

.. code:: console

   $ pyenv local 3.10.2 3.9.10 3.8.12 3.7.12

The first version listed is the one used when you type plain ``python``.
Every version can be used by invoking ``python<major.minor>``.
For example, use ``python3.7`` to invoke Python 3.7.


Requirements
------------

.. note::

   It is recommended to use pipx_ to install Python tools
   which are not specific to a single project.
   Please refer to the official documentation
   for detailed installation and usage instructions.
   If you decide to skip ``pipx`` installation,
   use `pip install`_ with the ``--user`` option instead.

.. _pip install: https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/reference/pip_install/

You need four tools to use this template:

- Cookiecutter_ to create projects from the template,
- Poetry_ to manage packaging and dependencies
- Nox_ to automate checks and other tasks
- nox-poetry_ for using Poetry in Nox sessions

Install Cookiecutter_ using pipx:

.. code:: console

   $ pipx install cookiecutter

Install Poetry_ by downloading and running install-poetry.py_:

.. _install-poetry.py: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/python-poetry/poetry/master/install-poetry.py

.. code:: console

   $ python install-poetry.py

Install Nox_ and nox-poetry_ using pipx:

.. code:: console

   $ pipx install nox
   $ pipx inject nox nox-poetry

Remember to upgrade these tools regularly:

.. code:: console

   $ pipx upgrade cookiecutter
   $ pipx upgrade --include-injected nox
   $ poetry self update


Project creation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. _Creating a project:

Creating a project
------------------

Create a project from this template
by pointing Cookiecutter to its `GitHub repository <DIGIT Skeleton Cookiecutter_>`__:

.. code:: console

   $ cookiecutter gh:lucasad83/digit-skeleton-cookiecutter

Cookiecutter downloads the template,
and asks you a series of questions about project variables,
for example, how you wish your project to be named.
When you have answered these questions,
your project is generated in the current directory,
using a subdirectory with the same name as your project.

Here is a complete list of the project variables defined by this template:

.. table:: Project variables
   :widths: auto

   ====================== ================================= ===================================
   Variable               Description                       Example
   ====================== ================================= ===================================
   ``project_name``       Project name on PyPI and GitHub   ``digit-python``
   ``package_name``       Import name of the package        ``digit_python``
   ``friendly_name``      Friendly project name             ``DIGIT Python``
   ``author``             Primary author                    Joe Doe
   ``email``              E-mail address of the author      joe@example.com
   ``github_user``        GitHub username of the author     ``joe``
   ``version``            Initial project version           ``0.0.0``
   ``copyright_year``     The project copyright year        ``2022``
   ``license``            The project license               ``MIT``
   ``development_status`` Development status of the project ``Development Status :: 3 - Alpha``
   ====================== ================================= ===================================

Your choices are recorded in the file ``.cookiecutter.json`` in the generated project,
together with the URL of this Cookiecutter template.
Having this JSON_ file in the project makes it possible later on
to update your project with changes from the Cookiecutter template,
using tools such as cupper_.

.. _JSON: https://www.json.org/
.. _cupper: https://github.com/senseyeio/cupper

In the remainder of this guide,
``<project>`` and ``<package>`` are used
to refer to the project and package names, respectively.
By default, their only difference is that
the project name uses hyphens (*kebab case*),
whereas the package name uses underscores (*snake case*).

.. _The initial package:

The initial package
-------------------

You can find the initial Python package in your generated project
under the ``src`` directory::

   src
   âââ <package>
       âââ __init__.py
       âââ __main__.py
       âââ py.typed

``__init__.py``
   This file declares the directory as a `Python package`_,
   and contains any package initialization code.

   .. _Python package: https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/modules.html#packages

``__main__.py``
   The `__main__`__ module defines the entry point for the command-line interface.
   The command-line interface is implemented using the Click_ library,
   and supports ``--help`` and ``--version`` options.
   When the package is installed,
   a script named ``<project>`` is placed
   in the Python installation or virtual environment.
   This allows you to invoke the command-line interface using only the project name:

   .. code:: console

      $ poetry run <project>  # during development
      $ <project>             # after installation

   The command-line interface can also be invoked
   by specifying a Python interpreter and the package name:

   .. code:: console

      $ python -m <package> [<options>]

   __ https://docs.python.org/3/library/__main__.html

``py.typed``
   This is an empty marker file,
   which declares that your package supports typing
   and is distributed with its own type information
   (`PEPÂ 561`_).
   This allows people using your package
   to type-check their Python code against it.


.. _The test suite:

The test suite
--------------

Tests are written using the pytest_ testing framework,
the *de facto* standard for testing in Python.

The test suite is located in the ``tests`` directory::

   tests
   âââ __init__.py
   âââ test_main.py

The test suite is `declared as a package`__,
and mirrors the source layout of the package under test.
The file ``test_main.py`` contains tests for the ``__main__`` module.

__ https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/explanation/goodpractices.html#choosing-a-test-layout-import-rules

Initially, the test suite contains a single test case,
checking whether the program exits with a status code of zero.
It also provides a `test fixture`_ using `click.testing.CliRunner`_,
a helper class for invoking the program from within tests.

.. _test fixture: https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/explanation/fixtures.html#about-fixtures
.. _click.testing.CliRunner: https://click.palletsprojects.com/en/7.x/testing/

For details on how to run the test suite,
refer to the section :ref:`The tests session`.


.. _Documentation:

Documentation
-------------

The project documentation is written in Markdown_
and processed by the Sphinx_ documentation engine.

The top-level directory contains several stand-alone documentation files:

``README.md``
   This file is your main project page.

``CONTRIBUTING.md``
   The Contributor Guide explains how other people can contribute to your project.

``CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md``
   The Code of Conduct outlines the behavior
   expected from participants of your project.
   It is adapted from the `Contributor Covenant`_, version 2.0.

.. _Contributor Covenant: https://www.contributor-covenant.org

``LICENSE.md``
   This file contains the text of your project's license.

The documentation files in the ``docs`` directory are built using Sphinx_:

``index.md``
   This is the main documentation page.
   It includes the project description from ``README.md``.
   This file also defines the navigation menu,
   with links to other documentation pages.

``contributing.md``
   This file includes the Contributor Guide from ``CONTRIBUTING.md``.

``codeofconduct.md``
   This file includes the Code of Conduct from ``CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md``.

``license.md``
   This file includes the license from ``LICENSE.md``.

``reference.md``
   The API reference for your project.
   It is generated from docstrings and type annotations in the source code,
   using the autodoc_ and napoleon_ extensions.

``usage.md``
   The command-line reference for your project.
   It is generated by inspecting the click_ entry-point in your package,
   using the sphinx-click_ extension.

The ``docs`` directory contains two more files:

``conf.py``
   This Python file contains the `Sphinx configuration`__.

__ https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/configuration.html

``requirements.txt``
   The requirements file pins the build dependencies for the Sphinx documentation.
   This file is only used on Read the Docs.

You can also build the documentation locally using Nox,
see :ref:`The docs session`.


Packaging
~~~~~~~~~

.. _The pyproject.toml file:

The pyproject.toml file
-----------------------

The configuration file for the Python package is located
in the root directory of the project,
and named ``pyproject.toml``.
It uses the TOML_ configuration file format,
and contains two sections---*tables* in TOML parlance---,
specified in `PEPÂ 517`_ and `518 <PEPÂ 518_>`__:

- The ``build-system`` table
  declares the requirements and the entry point
  used to build a distribution package for the project.
  This template uses Poetry_ as the build system.
- The ``tool`` table contains sub-tables
  where tools can store configuration under their PyPI_ name.

.. table:: Tool configurations in pyproject.toml
   :widths: auto

   ======================= ===============================
   ``tool.coverage``       Configuration for Coverage.py_
   ``tool.isort``          Configuration for isort_
   ``tool.mypy``           Configuration for mypy_
   ``tool.poetry``         Configuration for Poetry_
   ======================= ===============================

The ``tool.poetry`` table
contains the metadata for your package,
such as its name, version, and authors,
as well as the list of dependencies for the package.
Please refer to the `Poetry documentation <pyproject.toml_>`__
for a detailed description of each configuration key.

.. _pyproject.toml: https://python-poetry.org/docs/pyproject/


.. _Version constraints:

Version constraints
-------------------

.. admonition:: TL;DR

   This project template omits upper bounds from all version constraints.

   You are encouraged to manually remove upper bounds
   for dependencies you add to your project using Poetry:

   1. Replace ``^1.2.3`` with ``>=1.2.3`` in ``pyproject.toml``
   2. Run ``poetry lock --no-update`` to update ``poetry.lock``

`Version constraints <Versions and constraints_>`_ express
which versions of dependencies are compatible with your project.
In the case of core dependencies,
they are also a part of distribution packages,
and as such affect end-users of your package.

.. note::

   Dependencies are Python packages used by your project,
   and they come in two types:

   - *Core dependencies* are required by users running your code,
     and typically consist of third-party libraries imported by your package.
     When your package is distributed,
     the `package metadata`_ includes these dependencies,
     allowing tools like pip_ to automatically install them alongside your package.

   - *Development dependencies* are only required by developers working on your code.
     Examples are applications used to run tests,
     check code for style and correctness,
     or to build documentation.
     These dependencies are not a part of distribution packages,
     because users do not require them to run your code.

For every dependency added to your project,
Poetry writes a version constraint to ``pyproject.toml``.
Dependencies are kept in two TOML tables:

- ``tool.poetry.dependencies``---for core dependencies
- ``tool.poetry.dev-dependencies``---for development dependencies

By default, version constraints added by Poetry have both a lower and an upper bound:

- The lower bound requires users of your package to have at least the version
  that was current when you added the dependency.
- The upper bound allows users to upgrade to newer releases of dependencies,
  as long as the version number does not indicate a breaking change.

According to the `Semantic Versioning`_ standard,
only major releases may contain breaking changes,
once a project has reached version 1.0.0.
A major release is one that increments the major version
(the first component of the version identifier).
An example for such a version constraint would be ``^1.2.3``,
which is a Poetry-specific shorthand equivalent to ``>= 1.2.3, < 2``.

This project template omits upper bounds from all version constraints,
in a conscious departure from Poetry's defaults.
There are two separate reasons for removing version caps,
one principled, the other pragmatic:

1. Version caps lead to problems in the Python ecosystem due to its flat dependency management.
2. Version caps lead to frequent merge conflicts between dependency updates.

The first point is treated in detail in the following articles:

- `Should You Use Upper Bound Version Constraints? <https://iscinumpy.dev/post/bound-version-constraints/>`__ and `Poetry Versions <https://iscinumpy.dev/post/poetry-versions/>`__ by Henry Schreiner
- `Semantic Versioning Will Not Save You <https://hynek.me/articles/semver-will-not-save-you/>`__ by Hynek Schlawack
- `Version numbers: how to use them? <https://bernat.tech/posts/version-numbers/>`__ by BernÃ¡t GÃ¡bor
- `Why I don't like SemVer anymore <https://snarky.ca/why-i-dont-like-semver/>`__ by Brett Cannon

The second point is ultimately due to the fact that
every updated version constraint changes a hashsum in the ``poetry.lock`` file.
This means that PRs updating version constraints will *always* conflict with each other.

Poetry will still add ``^1.2.3``-style version constraints whenever you add a dependency.
You should edit the version constraint in ``pyproject.toml``,
replacing ``^1.2.3`` with ``>=1.2.3`` to remove the upper bound.
Then update the lock file by invoking ``poetry lock --no-update``.

.. _package metadata: https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/specifications/core-metadata/
.. _Versions and constraints: https://python-poetry.org/docs/dependency-specification/
.. _Semantic Versioning: https://semver.org/


.. _The lock file:

The lock file
-------------

Poetry records the exact version of each direct and indirect dependency
in its lock file, named ``poetry.lock`` and located in the root directory of the project.
The lock file does not affect users of the package,
because its contents are not included in distribution packages.

The lock file is useful for a number of reasons:

- It ensures that local checks run in the same environment as on the CI server,
  making the CI predictable and deterministic.
- When collaborating with other developers,
  it allows everybody to use the same development environment.
- When deploying an application, the lock file helps you
  keep production and development environments as similar as possible
  (`dev-prod parity`_).

.. _dev-prod parity: https://12factor.net/dev-prod-parity

For these reasons, the lock file should be kept under source control.


Dependencies
------------

This project template has a core dependency on Click_,
a library for creating command-line interfaces.
The template also comes with various development dependencies.
See the table below for an overview of the dependencies of generated projects:

.. important::

   It is recommended to remove the upper bound from the version constraint added by Poetry:

   1. Edit ``pyproject.toml`` to replace ``^1.2.3`` with ``>=1.2.3`` in the dependency entry
   2. Update ``poetry.lock`` using the command ``poetry lock --no-update``

   See `Version constraints`_ for more details.

Use the command `poetry remove`_ to remove a dependency from your package:

.. code:: console

   $ poetry remove foobar

.. _poetry remove: https://python-poetry.org/docs/cli/#remove

Use the command `poetry update`_ to upgrade the dependency to a new release:

.. code:: console

   $ poetry update foobar

.. _poetry update: https://python-poetry.org/docs/cli/#update


Installing the package for development
--------------------------------------

Poetry manages a virtual environment for your project,
which contains your package, its core dependencies, and the development dependencies.
All dependencies are kept at the versions specified by the lock file.

.. note::

   A `virtual environment`_ gives your project
   an isolated runtime environment,
   consisting of a specific Python version and
   an independent set of installed Python packages.
   This way, the dependencies of your current project
   do not interfere with the system-wide Python installation,
   or other projects you're working on.

   .. _virtual environment: https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/venv.html

You can install your package and its dependencies
into Poetry's virtual environment
using the command `poetry install`_.

.. code:: console

   $ poetry install

.. _poetry install: https://python-poetry.org/docs/cli/#install

This command performs a so-called `editable install`__ of your package:
Instead of building and installing a distribution package,
it creates a special ``.egg-link`` file that links to your local source code.
This means that code edits are directly visible in the environment
without the need to reinstall your package.

__ https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/cli/pip_install/#install-editable

Installing your package implicitly creates the virtual environment
if it does not exist yet,
using the currently active Python interpreter,
or the first one found
which satisfies the Python versions supported by your project.


Managing environments
---------------------

You can create environments explicitly
with the `poetry env`_ command,
specifying the desired Python version.
This allows you to create an environment
for every Python version supported by your project,
and easily switch between them:

.. _poetry env: https://python-poetry.org/docs/managing-environments/

.. code:: console

   $ poetry env use 3.7
   $ poetry env use 3.8
   $ poetry env use 3.9
   $ poetry env use 3.10

Only one Poetry environment can be active at any time.
Note that ``3.10`` comes last,
to ensure that the current Python release is the active environment.
Install your package with ``poetry install`` into each environment after creating it.

Use the command ``poetry env list`` to list the available environments:

.. code:: console

   $ poetry env list

Use the command ``poetry env remove`` to remove an environment:

.. code:: console

   $ poetry env remove <version>

Use the command ``poetry env info`` to show information about the active environment:

.. code:: console

   $ poetry env info


Running commands
----------------

You can run an interactive Python session inside the active environment
using the command `poetry run`_:

.. _poetry run: https://python-poetry.org/docs/cli/#run

.. code:: console

   $ poetry run python

The same command allows you to invoke the command-line interface of your project:

.. code:: console

   $ poetry run <project>

You can also run developer tools, such as pytest_:

.. code:: console

   $ poetry run pytest

While it is handy to have developer tools available in the Poetry environment,
it is usually recommended to run these using Nox,
as described in the section :ref:`Using Nox`.


.. _Using Nox:

Using Nox
~~~~~~~~~

Nox_ automates testing in multiple Python environments.
Like its older sibling tox_,
Nox makes it easy to run any kind of job in an isolated environment,
with only those dependencies installed that the job needs.

.. _tox: https://tox.readthedocs.io/

Nox sessions are defined in a Python file
named ``noxfile.py`` and located in the project directory.
They consist of a virtual environment
and a set of commands to run in that environment.

While Poetry environments allow you to
interact with your package during development,
Nox environments are used to run developer tools
in a reliable and repeatable way across Python versions.

Most sessions are run with every supported Python version.
Other sessions are only run with the current stable Python version,
for example the session used to build the documentation.


Running sessions
----------------

If you invoke Nox by itself, it will run the full test suite:

.. code:: console

   $ nox

This includes tests, linters, type checks, and more.
For the full list, please refer to the table `below <Table of Nox sessions_>`_.

The list of sessions run by default can be configured
by editing ``nox.options.sessions`` in ``noxfile.py``.
Currently the list only excludes the `docs session <The docs session_>`_
(which spawns an HTTP server)
and the `coverage session <The coverage session_>`_
(which is triggered by the `tests session <The tests session_>`_).

You can also run a specific Nox session, using the ``--session`` option.
For example, build the documentation like this:

.. code:: console

   $ nox --session=docs

Print a list of the available Nox sessions
using the ``--list-sessions`` option:

.. code:: console

   $ nox --list-sessions

Nox creates virtual environments from scratch on each invocation.
You can speed things up by passing the
`--reuse-existing-virtualenvs`_ option,
or the equivalent short option ``-r``.
For example, the following may be more practical during development
(this will only run tests and type checks, on the current Python release):

.. code:: console

   $ nox -p 3.10 -rs tests mypy

.. _--reuse-existing-virtualenvs: https://nox.thea.codes/en/stable/usage.html#re-using-virtualenvs

Many sessions accept additional options after ``--`` separator.
For example, the following command runs a specific test module:

.. code:: console

   $ nox --session=tests -- tests/test_main.py


Overview of Nox sessions
------------------------

.. _Table of Nox sessions:

The following table gives an overview of the available Nox sessions:

   ========================================== ===================================== ================== =========


.. _The docs session:

The docs session
----------------

Build the documentation using the Nox session ``docs``:

.. code:: console

   $ nox --session=docs

The docs session runs the command ``sphinx-autobuild`` to generate the HTML documentation from the Sphinx directory.
This tool has several advantages over ``sphinx-build`` when you are editing the documentation files:

- It rebuilds the documentation whenever a change is detected.
- It spins up a web server with live reloading.
- It opens the location of the web server in your browser.

Use the ``--`` separator to pass additional options.
For example, to treat warnings as errors and run in nit-picky mode:

.. code:: console

   $ nox --session=docs -- -W -n docs docs/_build

This Nox session always runs with the current major release of Python.


.. _The docs-build session:

The docs-build session
----------------------

The ``docs-build`` session runs the command ``sphinx-build`` to generate the HTML documentation from the Sphinx directory.

This session is meant to be run as a part of automated checks.
Use the interactive ``docs`` session instead while you're editing the documentation.

This Nox session always runs with the current major release of Python.


.. _The mypy session:

The mypy session
----------------

mypy_ is the pioneer and *de facto* reference implementation of static type checking in Python.
Learn more about it in the section :ref:`Type-checking with mypy`.

Run mypy using Nox:

.. code:: console

   $ nox --session=mypy

You can also run the type checker with a specific Python version.
For example, the following command runs mypy
using the current stable release of Python:

.. code:: console

   $ nox --session=mypy --python=3.10

Use the separator ``--`` to pass additional options and arguments to ``mypy``.
For example, the following command type-checks only the ``__main__`` module:

.. code:: console

   $ nox --session=mypy -- src/<package>/__main__.py


.. _The pre-commit session:

The pre-commit session
----------------------

pre-commit_ is a multi-language linter framework and a Git hook manager.
Learn more about it in the section :ref:`Linting with pre-commit`.

Run pre-commit from Nox using the ``pre-commit`` session:

.. code:: console

   $ nox --session=pre-commit

This session always runs with the current stable release of Python.

Use the separator ``--`` to pass additional options to ``pre-commit``.
For example, the following command installs the pre-commit hooks,
so they run automatically on every commit you make:

.. code:: console

   $ nox --session=pre-commit -- install


.. _The safety session:

The safety session
------------------

Safety_ checks the dependencies of your project for known security vulnerabilities,
using a curated database of insecure Python packages.
The |DSC| uses the `poetry export`_ command
to convert Poetry's lock file to a `requirements file`_,
for consumption by Safety.

.. _poetry export: https://python-poetry.org/docs/cli/#export
.. _requirements file: https://pip.readthedocs.io/en/stable/user_guide/#requirements-files

Run Safety_ using the ``safety`` session:

.. code:: console

   $ nox --session=safety

This session always runs with the current stable release of Python.


.. _The tests session:

The tests session
-----------------

Tests are written using the pytest_ testing framework.
Learn more about it in the section :ref:`The test suite`.

Run the test suite using the Nox session ``tests``:

.. code:: console

   $ nox --session=tests

The tests session runs the test suite against the installed code.
More specifically, the session builds a wheel from your project and
installs it into the Nox environment,
with dependencies pinned as specified by Poetry's lock file.

You can also run the test suite with a specific Python version.
For example, the following command runs the test suite
using the current stable release of Python:

.. code:: console

   $ nox --session=tests --python=3.10

Use the separator ``--`` to pass additional options to ``pytest``.
For example, the following command runs only the test case ``test_main_succeeds``:

.. code:: console

   $ nox --session=tests -- -k test_main_succeeds

The tests session also installs pygments_, a Python syntax highlighter.
It is used by pytest to highlight code in tracebacks,
improving the readability of test failures.


.. _The coverage session:

The coverage session
--------------------

.. note::

   *Test coverage* is a measure of the degree to which
   the source code of your program is executed
   while running its test suite.

The coverage session prints a detailed coverage report to the terminal,
combining the coverage data collected
during the :ref:`tests session <The tests session>`.
If the total coverage is below 100%,
the coverage session fails.
Code coverage is measured using `Coverage.py`_.

The coverage session is triggered by the tests session,
and runs after all other sessions have completed.
This allows it to combine the coverage data for different Python versions.

You can also run the session manually:

.. code:: console

   $ nox --session=coverage

Use the ``--`` separator to pass arguments to the ``coverage`` command.
For example, here's how you would generate an HTML report
in the ``htmlcov`` directory:

.. code:: console

   $ nox -rs coverage -- html

Coverage.py_ is configured in the ``pyproject.toml`` file,
using the ``tool.coverage`` table.
The configuration informs the tool about your package name and source tree layout.
It also enables branch analysis and the display of line numbers for missing coverage,
and specifies the target coverage percentage.
Coverage is measured for the package as well as `the test suite itself`__.

__ https://nedbatchelder.com/blog/202008/you_should_include_your_tests_in_coverage.html


.. _The typeguard session:

The typeguard session
---------------------

Typeguard_ is a runtime type checker and pytest_ plugin.
It can type-check function calls during test runs via an `import hook`__.

__ https://docs.python.org/3/reference/import.html#import-hooks

Typeguard checks that arguments passed to functions
match the type annotations of the function parameters,
and that the return value provided by the function
matches the return type annotation.
In the case of generator functions,
Typeguard checks the yields, sends and the return value
against the ``Generator`` annotation.

Run Typeguard_ using Nox:

.. code:: console

   $ nox --session=typeguard

The typeguard session runs the test suite with runtime type-checking enabled.
It is similar to the :ref:`tests session <The tests session>`,
with the difference that your package is instrumented by Typeguard.

This session always runs with the current stable release of Python.

Use the separator ``--`` to pass additional options and arguments to pytest.
For example, the following command runs only tests for the ``__main__`` module:

.. code:: console

   $ nox --session=typeguard -- tests/test_main.py

.. note::

   Typeguard generates a warning about missing type annotations for a Click object.
   This is due to the fact that ``__main__.main`` is wrapped by a decorator,
   and its type annotations only apply to the inner function,
   not the resulting object as seen by the test suite.


.. _The xdoctest session:

The xdoctest session
--------------------

The xdoctest_ tool
runs examples in your docstrings and
compares the actual output to the expected output as per the docstring.
This serves multiple purposes:

- The example is checked for correctness.
- You ensure that the documentation is up-to-date.
- Your codebase gets additional test coverage for free.

Run the tool using the Nox session ``xdoctest``:

.. code:: console

   $ nox --session=xdoctest

You can also run the test suite with a specific Python version.
For example, the following command runs the examples
using the current stable release of Python:

.. code:: console

   $ nox --session=xdoctest --python=3.10

By default, the Nox session uses the ``all`` subcommand to run all examples.
You can also list examples using the ``list`` subcommand,
or run specific examples:

.. code:: console

   $ nox --session=xdoctest -- list


.. _Linting with pre-commit:

Linting with pre-commit
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

pre-commit_ is a multi-language linter framework and a Git hook manager.
It allows you to
integrate linters and formatters into your Git workflow,
even when written in a language other than Python.

pre-commit is configured using the file ``.pre-commit-config.yaml``
in the project directory.
Please refer to the `official documentation`__
for details about the configuration file.

__ https://pre-commit.com/#adding-pre-commit-plugins-to-your-project


Running pre-commit from Nox
---------------------------

pre-commit runs in a Nox session every time you invoke ``nox``:

.. code:: console

   $ nox

Run the pre-commit session explicitly like this:

.. code:: console

   $ nox --session=pre-commit

The session is described in more detail in the section :ref:`The pre-commit session`.


Running pre-commit from git
---------------------------

When installed as a `Git hook`_,
pre-commit runs automatically every time you invoke ``git commit``.
The commit is aborted if any check fails.
When invoked in this mode, pre-commit only runs on files staged for the commit.

.. _Git hook: https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Customizing-Git-Git-Hooks

Install pre-commit as a Git hook by running the following command:

.. code:: console

   $ nox --session=pre-commit -- install


Managing hooks with pre-commit
------------------------------

Hooks in languages other than Python, such as ``prettier``,
run in isolated environments managed by pre-commit.
To upgrade these hooks, use the autoupdate__ command:

__ https://pre-commit.com/#pre-commit-autoupdate

.. code:: console

   $ nox --session=pre-commit -- autoupdate


Python-language hooks
---------------------

.. note::

   This section provides some background information about
   how this project template integrates pre-commit with Poetry and Nox.
   You can safely skip this section.

Python-language hooks in the |DSC| are not managed by pre-commit.
Instead, they are tracked as development dependencies in Poetry,
and installed into the Nox session alongside pre-commit itself.
As development dependencies, they are also present in the Poetry environment.

This approach has some advantages:

- All project dependencies are managed by Poetry.
- Hooks receive automatic upgrades from Dependabot.
- Nox can serve as a single entry point for all checks.
- Additional hook dependencies can be upgraded by a dependency manager.
  An example for this are Flake8 extensions.
  By contrast, ``pre-commit autoupdate`` does not include additional dependencies.
- Dependencies of dependencies (*subdependencies*) can be locked automatically,
  making checks more repeatable and deterministic.
- Linters and formatters are available in the Poetry environment,
  which is useful for editor integration.

There are also some drawbacks to this technique:

- This is not the officially supported way to integrate pre-commit hooks.
- The hook scripts installed by pre-commit do not activate the virtual environment
  in which pre-commit and the hooks are installed.
  To work around this limitation,
  the Nox session patches hook scripts on installation.
- Adding a hook is more work,
  including updating ``pyproject.toml`` and ``noxfile.py``, and
  adding the hook definition to ``pre-commit-config.yaml``.

You can always opt out of this integration method,
by removing the ``repo: local`` section from the configuration file,
and adding the official pre-commit hooks instead.
Don't forget to remove the hooks from Poetry's dependencies and from the Nox session.

.. note::

   Python-language hooks in the |DSC| are defined as `system hooks`__.
   System hooks don't have their environments managed by pre-commit;
   instead, pre-commit assumes that hook dependencies have already been installed
   and are available in its environment.
   The Nox session for pre-commit takes care of
   installing the Python hooks alongside pre-commit.

   __ https://pre-commit.com/#system

   Furthermore, the |DSC| defines Python-language hooks as `repository-local hooks`__.
   As such, hook definitions are not supplied by the hook repositories,
   but by the project itself.
   This makes it possible to override the hook language to ``system``, as explained above.

   __ https://pre-commit.com/#repository-local-hooks


Adding an official pre-commit hook
----------------------------------

Adding the official pre-commit hook for a linter is straightforward.
Often you can simply copy a configuration snippet from the repository's ``README``.
Otherwise, note the hook identifier from the ``pre-commit-hooks.yaml`` file,
and the git tag for the latest version.
Add the following section to your ``pre-commit-config.yaml``, under ``repos``:

.. code:: yaml

   - repo: <hook repository>
     rev: <version tag>
     hooks:
       - id: <hook identifier>

While this technique also works for Python-language hooks,
it is recommended to integrate Python hooks with Nox and Poetry,
as shown in the next section.


Adding a Python-language hook
-----------------------------

Adding a Python-language hook to your project takes three steps:

- Add the hook as a Poetry development dependency.
- Install the hook in the Nox session for pre-commit.
- Add the hook to ``pre-commit-config.yaml``.

For example, consider a linter named ``awesome-linter``.

First, use Poetry to add the linter to your development dependencies:

.. code:: console

   $ poetry add --dev awesome-linter

Next, update ``noxfile.py`` to add the linter to the pre-commit session:

.. code:: python

   @nox.session(name="pre-commit", ...)
   def precommit(session: Session) -> None:
       ...
       session.install(
           "awesome-linter",  # Install awesome-linter
           "black",
           "darglint",
           ...
       )

Finally, add the hook to ``pre-commit-config.yaml`` as follows:

- Locate the ``pre-commit-hooks.yaml`` file in the ``awesome-linter`` repository.
- Copy the entry for the hook (not just the hook identifier).
- Change ``language:`` from ``python`` to ``system``.
- Add the hook definition to the ``repo: local`` section.

Depending on the linter, the hook definition might look somewhat like the following:

.. code:: yaml

   repos:
     - repo: local
       hooks:
         # ...
         - id: awesome-linter
           name: Awesome Linter
           entry: awesome-linter
           language: system  # was: python
           types: [python]


Running checks on modified files
--------------------------------

pre-commit runs checks on the *staged* contents of files.
Any local modifications are stashed for the duration of the checks.
This is motivated by pre-commit's primary use case,
validating changes staged for a commit.

Requiring changes to be staged allows for a nice property:
Many pre-commit hooks support fixing offending lines automatically,
for example ``black``, ``prettier``, and ``isort``.
When this happens,
your original changes are in the staging area,
while the fixes are in the work tree.
You can accept the fixes by staging them with ``git add``
before committing again.

If you want to run linters or formatters on modified files,
and you do not want to stage the modifications just yet,
you can also invoke the tools via Poetry instead.
For example, use ``poetry run flake8 <file>`` to lint a modified file with Flake8.


Overview of pre-commit hooks
----------------------------

The |DSC| comes with a pre-commit configuration consisting of the following hooks:

.. table:: pre-commit hooks
   :widths: auto

   ======================== ===============================================
   `black <Black_>`__       Run the Black_ code formatter
   `flake8 <Flake8_>`__     Run the Flake8_ linter
   isort_                   Rewrite source code to sort Python imports
   `prettier <Prettier_>`__ Run the Prettier_ code formatter
   pyupgrade_               Upgrade syntax to newer versions of Python
   check-added-large-files_ Prevent giant files from being committed
   check-toml_              Validate TOML_ files
   check-yaml_              Validate YAML_ files

   trailing-whitespace_     Ensure lines do not contain trailing whitespace
   ======================== ===============================================

.. _check-toml: https://github.com/pre-commit/pre-commit-hooks#check-toml
.. _check-yaml: https://github.com/pre-commit/pre-commit-hooks#check-yaml
.. _check-added-large-files: https://github.com/pre-commit/pre-commit-hooks#check-added-large-files
.. _end-of-file-fixer: https://github.com/pre-commit/pre-commit-hooks#end-of-file-fixer
.. _trailing-whitespace: https://github.com/pre-commit/pre-commit-hooks#trailing-whitespace


The Black hook
--------------

Black_ is the uncompromising Python code formatter.
One of its greatest features is its lack of configurability.
Blackened code looks the same regardless of the project you're reading.


The Prettier hook
-----------------

Prettier_ is an opinionated code formatter for many languages,
including YAML, Markdown, and JavaScript.
Like Black, it has few options,
and the |DSC| uses none of them.


.. _The Flake8 hook:

The Flake8 hook
---------------

Flake8_ is an extensible linter framework for Python.
For more details, see the section :ref:`Linting with Flake8`.


.. _The isort hook:

The isort hook
--------------

isort_ reorders imports in your Python code.
Imports are separated into three sections,
as recommended by `PEPÂ 8`_: standard library, third party, first party.
There are two additional sections,
one at the top for `future imports <https://docs.python.org/3/library/__future__.html>`__,
the other at the bottom for `relative imports <https://docs.python.org/3/reference/import.html#package-relative-imports>`__.
Within each section, ``from`` imports follow normal imports.
Imports are then sorted alphabetically.

The |DSC| activates the `Black profile <https://pycqa.github.io/isort/docs/configuration/black_compatibility.html>`__ for compatibility with the Black code formatter.
Furthermore, the `force_single_line <https://pycqa.github.io/isort/docs/configuration/options.html#force-single-line>`__ setting is enabled.
This splits imports onto separate lines to avoid merge conflicts.
Finally, two blank lines are enforced after imports for consistency,
via the `lines_after_imports <https://pycqa.github.io/isort/docs/configuration/options.html#lines-after-imports>`__ setting.


The pyupgrade hook
------------------

pyupgrade_ upgrades your source code
to newer versions of the Python language and standard library.
The tool analyzes the `abstract syntax tree`__ of the modules in your project,
replacing deprecated or legacy usages with modern idioms.

The minimum supported Python version is declared in the relevant section of ``.pre-commit-config.yaml``.
You should change this setting whenever you drop support for an old version of Python.

__ https://docs.python.org/3/library/ast.html


Hooks from pre-commit-hooks
---------------------------

The pre-commit configuration also includes several smaller hooks
from the pre-commit-hooks_ repository.


.. _Linting with Flake8:

Linting with Flake8
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Flake8_ is an extensible linter framework for Python,
and a command-line utility to run the linters on your source code.
The |DSC| integrates Flake8 via a pre-commit_ hook,
see the section :ref:`The Flake8 hook`.

The configuration file for Flake8 and its extensions
is named ``.flake8`` and located in the project directory.
For details about the configuration file, see the `official reference`__.

__ https://flake8.pycqa.org/en/latest/user/configuration.html

The sections below describe the linters in more detail.
Each section also notes any configuration settings applied by the |DSC|.


Overview of available plugins
-----------------------------

Flake8 comes with a rich ecosystem of plugins.
The following table lists the Flake8 plugins used by the |DSC|,
and links to their lists of error codes.

.. table:: Flake8 plugins
   :widths: auto

   ================================ ============================================= ======================================

   ================================ ============================================= ======================================


pyflakes
--------

pyflakes_ parses Python source files and finds invalid code.
Warnings reported by this tool include
syntax errors,
undefined names,
unused imports or variables,
and more.
It is included with Flake8_ by default.

`Error codes`__ are prefixed by ``F`` for "flake".

.. _pyflakes codes:
__ https://flake8.pycqa.org/en/latest/user/error-codes.html


pycodestyle
-----------

pycodestyle_ checks your code against the style recommendations of `PEPÂ 8`_,
the official Python style guide.
The tool detects
whitespace and indentation issues,
deprecated features,
bare excepts,
and much more.
It is included with Flake8_ by default.

`Error codes`__ are prefixed by ``W`` for warnings and ``E`` for errors.

.. _pycodestyle codes:
__ https://pycodestyle.pycqa.org/en/latest/intro.html#error-codes

The |DSC| disables the following errors and warnings
for compatibility with Black_ and flake8-bugbear_:

- ``E203`` (whitespace before ``:``)
- ``E501`` (line too long)
- ``W503`` (line break before binary operator)


pep8-naming
-----------

pep8-naming_ enforces the naming conventions from `PEPÂ 8`_.
Examples are the use of camel case for the names of classes,
the use of lowercase for the names of functions, arguments and variables,
or the convention to name the first argument of methods ``self``.

`Error codes`__ are prefixed by ``N`` for "naming".

.. _pep8-naming codes:
__ https://github.com/pycqa/pep8-naming#pep-8-naming-conventions


pydocstyle and flake8-docstrings
--------------------------------

pydocstyle_ checks that docstrings comply with the recommendations of `PEPÂ 257`_
and a configurable style convention.
It is integrated with Flake8 via the flake8-docstrings_ extension.
Warnings range from missing docstrings to
issues with whitespace, quoting, and docstring content.

`Error codes`__ are prefixed by ``D`` for "docstring".

.. _pydocstyle codes:
__ http://www.pydocstyle.org/en/stable/error_codes.html

The |DSC| selects the recommendations of the
`Google styleguide <Google docstring style_>`__.
Here is an example of a function documented in Google style:

.. code:: python

   def add(first: int, second: int) -> int:
       """Add two integers.

       Args:
           first: The first argument.
           second: The second argument.

       Returns:
           The sum of the arguments.
       """

.. _Google docstring style: https://google.github.io/styleguide/pyguide.html#38-comments-and-docstrings


flake8-rst-docstrings
---------------------

flake8-rst-docstrings_ validates docstring markup as reStructuredText_.
Docstrings must be valid reStructuredText
because they are used by Sphinx to generate the API reference.

`Error codes`__ are prefixed by ``RST`` for "reStructuredText",
and group issues into numerical blocks, by their severity and origin.

.. _flake8-rst-docstrings codes:
__ https://github.com/peterjc/flake8-rst-docstrings#flake8-validation-codes


flake8-bugbear
--------------

flake8-bugbear_ detects bugs and design problems.
The warnings are more opinionated than those of pyflakes or pycodestyle.
For example,
the plugin detects Python 2 constructs which have been removed in Python 3,
and likely bugs such as function arguments defaulting to empty lists or dictionaries.

`Error codes`__ are prefixed by ``B`` for "bugbear".

.. _flake8-bugbear codes:
__ https://github.com/PyCQA/flake8-bugbear#list-of-warnings

The |DSC| also enables Bugbear's ``B9`` warnings,
which are disabled by default.
In particular, ``B950`` checks the maximum line length
like pycodestyle_'s ``E501``,
but with a tolerance margin of 10%.
This soft limit is set to 80 characters,
which is the value used by the Black code formatter.


mccabe
------

mccabe_ checks the `code complexity <Cyclomatic complexity_>`__
of your Python package against a configured limit.
The tool is included with Flake8_.

`Error codes`__ are prefixed by ``C`` for "complexity".

.. _mccabe codes:
__ https://github.com/PyCQA/mccabe#plugin-for-flake8

The |DSC| limits code complexity to a value of 10.

.. _Cyclomatic complexity: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyclomatic_complexity


.. _darglint integration:

darglint
--------

darglint_ checks that docstring descriptions match function definitions.
The tool has its own configuration file, named ``.darglint``.

`Error codes`__ are prefixed by ``DAR`` for "darglint".

.. _darglint codes:
__ https://github.com/terrencepreilly/darglint#error-codes

The |DSC| allows one-line docstrings without function signatures.
Multi-line docstrings must
specify the function signatures completely and correctly,
using `Google docstring style`_.


Bandit
------

Bandit_ is a tool designed to
find common security issues in Python code,
and integrated via the flake8-bandit_ extension.

`Error codes`__ are prefixed by ``S`` for "security".
(The prefix ``B`` for "bandit" is used
when Bandit is run as a stand-alone tool.)

.. _Bandit codes:
__ https://bandit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/plugins/index.html#complete-test-plugin-listing

The |DSC| disables ``S101`` (use of assert) for the test suite,
as pytest_ uses assertions to verify expectations in tests.


.. _Type-checking with mypy:

Type-checking with mypy
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. note::

   `Type annotations`_, first introduced in Python 3.5,
   are a way to annotate functions and variables with types.
   With appropriate tooling,
   they can make your programs easier to understand, debug, and maintain.

   .. _Type annotations: https://docs.python.org/3/library/typing.html

   *Type-checking* refers to the practice of
   verifying the type correctness of a program,
   using type annotations and type inference.
   There are two kinds of type checkers:

   - *Static type checkers* verify the type correctness of your program
     without executing it, using static analysis.
   - *Runtime type checkers* find type errors by instrumenting your code to
     type-check arguments and return values in function calls.
     This is particularly useful during the execution of unit tests.

   There is also an increasing number of libraries
   that leverage type annotations at runtime.
   For example, you can use type annotations to generate serialization schemas
   or command-line parsers.

mypy_ is the pioneer and *de facto* reference implementation of static type checking in Python.
Invoke mypy via Nox, as explained in the section :ref:`The mypy session`.

mypy is configured in the ``pyproject.toml`` file,
using the ``tool.mypy`` table. For details about supported configuration
options, see the `official reference`__.

__ https://mypy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/config_file.html

The |DSC| enables several configuration options which are off by default.
The following options are enabled for strictness and enhanced output:

- :option:`strict <mypy --strict>`
- :option:`warn_unreachable <mypy --warn-unreachable>`
- :option:`pretty <mypy --pretty>`
- :option:`show_column_numbers <mypy --show-column-numbers>`
- :option:`show_error_codes <mypy --show-error-codes>`
- :option:`show_error_context <mypy --show-error-context>`


.. _Tutorials:

Tutorials
~~~~~~~~~

First, make sure you have all the :ref:`requirements <Installation>` installed.


.. _How to test your project:

How to test your project
------------------------

Run the test suite using :ref:`Nox <Using Nox>`:

.. code:: console

   $ nox -r


How to run your code
--------------------

First, install the project and its dependencies to the Poetry environment:

.. code:: console

   $ poetry install

Run an interactive session in the environment:

.. code:: console

   $ poetry run python

Invoke the command-line interface of your package:

.. code:: console

   $ poetry run <project>


How to make code changes
------------------------

1. | Run the tests, :ref:`as explained above <How to test your project>`.
   | All tests should pass.
2. | Add a failing test :ref:`under the tests directory <The test suite>`.
   | Run the tests again to verify that your test fails.
3. | Make your changes to the package, :ref:`under the src directory <The initial package>`.
   | Run the tests to verify that all tests pass again.


How to push code changes
------------------------

Create a branch for your changes:

.. code:: console

   $ git switch --create my-topic-branch main

Create a series of small, single-purpose commits:

.. code:: console

   $ git add <files>
   $ git commit

Push your branch to GitHub:

.. code:: console

   $ git push --set-upstream origin my-topic-branch

The push triggers the following automated steps:

- :ref:`The test suite runs against your branch <The Tests workflow>`.


How to open a pull request
--------------------------

Open a pull request for your branch on GitHub:

1. Select your branch from the *Branch* menu.
2. Click **New pull request**.
3. Enter the title for the pull request.
4. Enter a description for the pull request.
5. Apply a :ref:`label identifying the type of change <The Release workflow>`
6. Click **Create pull request**.

Release notes are pre-filled with the titles of merged pull requests.


How to accept a pull request
----------------------------

If all checks are marked as passed,
merge the pull request using the squash-merge strategy (recommended):

1. Click **Squash and Merge**.
   (Select this option from the dropdown menu of the merge button, if it is not shown.)
2. Click **Confirm squash and merge**.
3. Click **Delete branch**.

This triggers the following automated steps:

- :ref:`The test suite runs against the main branch <The Tests workflow>`.
- :ref:`The draft GitHub Release is updated <The Release workflow>`.
- :ref:`A pre-release of the package is uploaded to TestPyPI <The Release workflow>`.
- `Read the Docs`_ rebuilds the *latest* version of the documentation.

In your local repository,
update the main branch:

.. code:: console

   $ git switch main
   $ git pull origin main

Optionally, remove the merged topic branch
from the local repository as well:

.. code:: console

   $ git remote prune origin
   $ git branch --delete --force my-topic-branch

The original commits remain accessible from the pull request
(*Commits* tab).


How to make a release
---------------------

Releases are triggered by a version bump on the default branch.
It is recommended to do this in a separate pull request:

1. Switch to a branch.
2. Bump the version using `poetry version`_.
3. Commit and push to GitHub.
4. Open a pull request.
5. Merge the pull request.

.. _poetry version: https://python-poetry.org/docs/cli/#version

The individual steps for bumping the version are:

.. code:: console

   $ git switch --create release main
   $ poetry version <version>
   $ git commit --message="<project> <version>" pyproject.toml
   $ git push origin release

If you're not sure which version number to choose,
read about `Semantic Versioning`_.
Versioning rules for Python packages are laid down in `PEPÂ 440`_.
